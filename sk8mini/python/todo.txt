x keep multiple logs, named same as awacs photo dir
x linesegs use tighter turning radius than arcs
x starting out with list to port, bias 19 too high -	added bias to args
x route plan, make sure the northmost cone is slightly to the west
x skate does not reposition itself after calibration
x skateline does not redraw
x git commit
x run without nosave
x 	capture photos in tight circle around a mark
x	measure turning radius, cone diameter, skate center to donut edge
		9227_83: 9238_67
		x: 392-285=107 px
		y: 234-126=108 px
		turning radius = 54px * .44 = 23.76cm
		center wheel base to donut edge: 318-285=33 px * .44 =  14.5cm 
x replace global heading and roll
x rename AHRS to Sensor (IMU, AHRS, BRO055, etc)
x rename gmem to smem
x remove heading and roll from smem
x integrate jlog and caplog
x bug: skate correct, UI skateline wrong
x normalize anles to 0:360 by taking the input value mod 360.

cannot handle ccw loop

draw proper skate
wheelbase       = 13.0  # cm
wheeltrack      = 16.5  # cm
wheel_width     =  2.6  # cm
deck_width      = 10.0  # cm
deck_length     = 28.0  # cm



measure time diff between onSensor and onPhoto

in UI, when entering arc leg, skateline jumps closer to the cone

does not meet onMark() for exit of leg2, the arc
	use theta
	
ccw rounding a mark jerks back and forth between -90 and +90

Timing
	AWACS .3 sec, is limiting factor camera or http?
	Skate 
		Get photo, donut and cones. Timing controlled by AWACS loop: .3 secs
		Get sensor, read settle time? Is it conflicting with send command?
	Navigation 
		1st leg
		Last leg
		Cones changed plotRoute
		Navigator
			Get cones from photo
			On change, re-plotRoute
			Keep sides and rdirs, unless route becomes impossible
	Pilot
		Stay on course controlled by getPhoto
	UI
		Fps 20, wasted because no changes to see except when photo changes





future option: add deadReckoning on change in heading or roll, between onSensor and onPhoto.  NO.  skip deadReckoning and instead go to to awacs direct comm of donut to skate

onPhoto()
	donut x,y, t
	donutpos
	cbaseposhj
	timestarthttp
	timereceivedbyskate

onSensor()
	heading, roll, t

caplog
	source - onPhoto, onAHRS
	position	
	heading
	roll
	speed - can be calculated from helm and roll, or from newpos vs prevpos line vs arc 
	timestamp
	revised_position

Photo
	donut
	position - calculated from donut, heading, roll
	heading - copied from sensor log at matching timestamp
	roll - copied from log at matching timestamp
	speed - copied from log at matching timestamp
	timestamp - photo received from awacs
	timehttp - time http request sent

Sensor
	heading - including declination
	roll
	timestamp - signal received from BRO055

options before go, after go
	turn autopilot off
	use left and right arrows to move helm
	display helm, roll
