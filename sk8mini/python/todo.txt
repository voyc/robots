throttle adjustment is relative to roll, not helm

	throttle : speed : distance : roll adjustment
	helm : arm angle : roll
	roll : turning radius : axle angle : outer wheel speed : inner wheel speed
	roll : deck center : wheelbase center

	distance: cm, px, cm:px
	speed: cm/sec, px/sec

	angular velocity

https://www.geogebra.org/geometry/w3kqwan9
	turning radius inner = 23 - 8.25 = 14.75 * 2pi =  92.67 = circum
	turning radius center            = 23.00 * 2pi = 144.51
	turning radius outer = 23 + 8.25 = 31.25 * 2pi = 196.35

inner_circum  =  92.67 # cm
center_circum = 144.51 # cm
outer_circum  = 196.35 # cm

# motor is on right rear wheel

# at throttle 23, speed is 144 cm/ n secs

# for one full circle
# wheel circum 17
# at right turn,    right wheel outer rim travels  92 cm,  92/17 =  5.4 revs
# on straight-away, right wheel outer rim travels 144 cm, 144/17 =  8.5 revs 
# at left turn,     right wheel outer rim travels 196 cm, 196/17 = 11.5 revs

#  5.4/8.5
# 11.5/8.5

# (144-92)/144 = .361
# (196-144)/144 = .361
# ( 8.5-5.4)/8.5 = .365
# (11.5-8.5)/8.5 = .353

throttle interpolate

input -100 to +100
output 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,35,36,38,40

if input <= 3
	output = 0
else
	factor = 40 to 100
	output = input -3 * factor

throttle is always set to 50%
adjusted can be 0 or 4 to 43

pid controller
PV process variable, roll
r(t) = set point: 0
y(t) = measurement: ahrs.roll
e(t) = error: r(t) - y(t)
u(t) = control variable, output: helm, set to weighted sum of P,I,D
Kp = proportional 
Ki = integral
Kd = derivative

P = Kp * e(t)

CV = u = (Kp * error) + (Kd * (dError / dt)) + (Ki * areaError  (area + (Error * dt))

currently, vehicle has consistent list to starboard
task 1: find helm offset that results in a straight line

non-zero rudder results in steadily changing heading
zero rudder = helm + helm_offset

user wants to think helm is at zero, actually it is at the offset
if offset is 2, helm must be 2 to keep rudder at zero

helm offset => zero rudder => straight line



rudder_angle = axle_angle * 2
deck_angle  and rudder angle are remarkably close

axle is mounted at 45 degrees
straight-ahead, axle is perpendicular to deck
deck angle 19 => axle angle 10

direct connection between roll and rudder
roll = deck_angle
rudder = axle_angle * 2
rudder affects heading
helm throws the weight

roll:rudder interpolation
19:20
consideer it 20:20, ie 1:1


when going straight, we want the rudder at 0
if roll is 10
	bring it back to zero

PID step 1, keep rudder at 0
PID step 2, keep heading at bearing, both change with vehicle position
