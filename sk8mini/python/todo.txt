x keep multiple logs, named same as awacs photo dir
x linesegs use tighter turning radius than arcs
x starting out with list to port, bias 19 too high -	added bias to args
x route plan, make sure the northmost cone is slightly to the west
x skate does not reposition itself after calibration
x skateline does not redraw

skateline redraw
	only two red dots
	starts out ok but then takes off at wrong angle and length stretching
	length of skate, stretching and shrinking

copy.deepcopy()  heading vs ahrs.heading: is heading a copy?
ahrs changing rapidly, 
heading and roll changing more slowly
UI changing even more slowly

	
route - two arcs are drawn around each cone


arc next leg
	"to" is too far east, meaning turning radius bigger than actual
	maybe try measuring theta rather than point


x git commit
x run without nosave
x 	capture photos in tight circle around a mark
x	measure turning radius, cone diameter, skate center to donut edge
		9227_83: 9238_67
		x: 392-285=107 px
		y: 234-126=108 px
		turning radius = 54px * .44 = 23.76cm
		center wheel base to donut edge: 318-285=33 px * .44 =  14.5cm 
x replace global heading and roll
x rename AHRS to Sensor (IMU, AHRS, BRO055, etc)
x rename gmem to smem
x remove heading and roll from smem
integrate jlog and caplog
measure time diff between onSensor and onPhoto

bug: skate correct, UI skateline wrong
does not meet onMark() for exit of leg2, the arc

future option: add deadReckoning on change in heading or roll, between onSensor and onPhoto
no.  skip deadReckoning and instead go to to awacs direct comm of donut to skate

onPhoto()
	donut x,y, t
	donutpos
	cbaseposhj
	timestarthttp
	timereceivedbyskate

onSensor()
	heading, roll, t

caplog
	source - onPhoto, onAHRS
	position	
	heading
	roll
	speed - can be calculated from helm and roll, or from newpos vs prevpos line vs arc 
	timestamp
	revised_position

Photo
	donut
	position - calculated from donut, heading, roll
	heading - copied from sensor log at matching timestamp
	roll - copied from log at matching timestamp
	speed - copied from log at matching timestamp
	timestamp - photo received from awacs
	timehttp - time http request sent

Sensor
	heading - including declination
	roll
	timestamp - signal received from BRO055

options before go, after go
	turn autopilot off
	use left and right arrows to move helm
	display helm, roll

How much money should the US government borrow everyday to give to Zelensky for Ukraine military operations?
ditto Netanyahu for Israeli military operations?
