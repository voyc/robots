pid = port id


^ name ^ FQBN ^ PID ^
| Arduino UNO | arduino:avr:uno |  |


In the FQBN arduino:avr:uno:
  * arduino is the Package (or Packager or Vendor)
  * arduino:avr is the Platform where:
    * arduino is the Package (or Packager or Vendor)
    * avr is the CPU Architecture
  * uno is the Board Identifier (or just Board)

oIn this explanation, "platform is now synonymous for CPU Architecture within a Package"o

platform = package + cpu architecture



two new terms were introduced
  * CPU Architecture
  * 



package contains multiple platforms, one for each cpu architecture.
