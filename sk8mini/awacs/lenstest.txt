longlens
	120 degrees
	good light in all three framesizes tested
dcxv2
	120 degrees
	same fov as longlens
	high res images very dark
	svga greenish
	svga cannot go to quality=4 like longlens
dcv3r
	160 degrees
	high res images very dark



the longlens has good light
both dc* cams have good light in the svga res, but are too dark at higher res
bright sunlight coming thru may be closing the aperature
but pictures taken at night were even darker

dcv34r has higher fov
but also has less fisheye distortion
lenc=1 (lens correction) set on all three tests, maybe it works best with this cam
I must assume this cam is 160 degrees and the other two are 120


no
the two dc* cams have higher fov
the longlens has lower fov but more distortion
lower fov means larger objects, more pixels per object
all three cams will have to be cropped, but longlens the least
