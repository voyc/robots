label.py - label management library

A label is a two-dimensional list of integers, 
one row for each detected object in an image.

A label object is stored in a .csv file.
example filenames:
00001.jpg - the image
00001_label.csv - the label file
00001_truth.csv - a perfected label file, "ground truth", used for training

Three use cases:
	1. training: compare computed label to truth
	2. serving: realtime data broadcast and used for navigation

The typical label file in AI is a bbox, plus optional keypoints.

sk8 Format
	the first column is the classifier
	the next five columns represent the rotated rectangle

this list is assumed to have been sorted, ala sorted(label)

#------------------- data structures ------------------#
'''	
data structures:
	label - [cls, cx,cy,w,h,hdg, scr] - sk8mini format
	rect  - ((cx,cy), (wr,hr), angle) - rotated rect returned from cv2,minAreaRect(contour)
	bbox  - left,top,w,h - bounding box returned from cv2.boundingRect(contour)

also: 
	labels - a list of of label objects

notes on rotated rect
	when rect is upright, h > w
	when rect is supine,  w > h
	when rect is square, the 1st line segment is the top, not the side
		therefore, a is never 0, it goes to 90
		(in a similar way, hdg is never 360, it goes to 0)

To better understand the rect, look at the four points returned from cv2.boxPoints(rect)
	the first point is the left-top (lowest x, with lowest y as tie-breaker)
	remaining points proceed clockwise
	1st line segment is considered h
	2nd line segment is considered w

#-------------------------- angle vs heading -------------------#
'''
original angle returned from cv2.minAreaRect() is 1 to 90
fudged angle is from 1 to 180
heading is from 0 to 259

angle implies two alternate headings: one to the east, one to the west
additional data is required to narrow the choice to one heading.
