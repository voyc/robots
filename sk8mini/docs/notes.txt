- 3D modeling:  new drive motor mount
circuit design: work book projects using transistors
circuit design: low battery indicator: zener diodes, transistors
programming: coast and brake routines for the servo continuous
programming: test imu
programming: commands for full starboard and full port and amidship

ESP32 15x7
perfboard 24x18
breadboard 30x10+4


20cm deck width (at center, 16cm min, 20.5cm max)
70cm deck length (13cm overhang, 10cm front 17cm rear)
1.2cm deck thickness

44cm wheelbase: wheel to wheel centers
17.5cm wheel track: distance between wheel centerlines

7cm wheel diameter
5cm wheel width
8cm wheel center to decktop

3.3 new wheel diameter


deck width~20~20cm deck width (at center, 16cm min, 20.5cm max)
deck length~70~70cm deck length (13cm overhang, 10cm front 17cm rear)
deck thickness~1.2~1.2cm deck thickness
wheelbase~44~44cm wheelbase: wheel to wheel centers
wheel track~17.5~17.5cm wheel track: distance between wheel centerlines
wheel diameter~7~7cm wheel diameter
wheel width~5~5cm wheel width
wheel clearance~8~8cm wheel center to decktop

mobile power
ideal
	1 7.4V lipo battery for two servos
	1 voltage divider to provide 3.7V to ESP32
	1 power switch
	1 LED power on indicator
	1 usb connector: allows program upload, plus auto onboard recharging whenever plugged in
	note: vehicle cannot be used when usb cable connected
	full bms 
		warn low battery condition
		auto shutdown on:
			overcharge 
			undercharge 
			too fast discharge 
			overheat

simple (for now)
	3 18650's
	3 18650 holders (1 single for ESP32, 1 double in series for servos)
	1 separate charger: manually remove batteries from vehicle, place in charger
	2 power switches
	2 power on/off LED's
	when usb cable plugged into ESP32, do NOT turn on power to ESP32
	no onboard bms
	
keep separate development board for program testing with duplicate servos not connected to vehicle

M2 screws used to mount servomotor to board, 2mm threadsize, 1.5mm pilot hole
M3 bolts connect arm to servo, and weight to arm
M4 Meccano bolts and axles

The preferred walking speed is the speed at which humans or animals choose to walk. Many people tend to walk at about 1.42 metres per second (5.1 km/h; 3.2 mph; 4.7 ft/s).

Wheel diameter: 3.5cm
Circumference: 11cm
At 60 rpm: 11cm per second = .11 * 1000 * .000277778 = 0.03055558 km/h
at 45rpm: .11m * 45r = 4.95m/m : 4.95/60 = .0825m/s
