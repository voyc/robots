GPIO21 to SDA   A4   green

A4 and A5, per https://www.instructables.com/MPU-6050-Tutorial-How-to-Program-MPU-6050-With-Ard/


ESP32 serial comm
5V  voltage input
GND
UOR/GPIO3
UOT/GPIO1
when burning, short IO0 to GND

FTDI, six pins, four used:
DTR/RTS request to send
RX
TX
VCC voltage output, 3.3V or 5V depending on jumper
CTS clear to send
GND

Pin map to burn ESP32-CAM with FTDI chip:
^ FTDI ^ ESP32-CAM ^ comment ^
| VCC | 5V  | keep FTDI jumper to 5V |
| GND | GND | |
| RX  | UOT | r to t and vice-versa |
| TX  | UOR | t to r   |
|     | IO0 | jumper short to ground  |
|     | GND | jumper   |

Both the ESP32-CAM and the FTDI offer a choice between 3.3V and 5V.
DronebotWorkshop recommends 3.3V.

MicrocontrollersLab recommends 5V.

Ubuntu 22 requires a mod for CH340 chip, due to naming conflict with Braille keyboard.

As of 2023, three different USB-to-serial chips are being
used for uploading a program into a microcontroller.
1.
2.
3.


Requirements.
1. Use one power supply all the time.  Do not switch power supply to USB port just because you are uploading.
2. No jumpers.  One reset switch is OK.  If port is plugged in, receive the data and load it.

When I plug the USB in, it means I want to upload a new firmware, OR I want to recharge the battery.
This works only for a battery pack at 5V or less.

BMS with charging
For n number of 3.7V cells. For a given SnP configuration.

UART - Universally Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter

TTL - transistor-transistor logic

TTL UART serial comm  
  * 0 bit = 0V 
  * 1 bit = 5V

RS232, serial comm from the days of teletype machines, high voltages
0 bit = "space" = +3V ~ +15V
1 bit = "mark" = -15V ~ -3V
These serial protocols are 1:1.  One host, one peripheral.

USB, Universal Serial Bus, is a "bus" architecture, meaning multiple peripherals can all be plugged into the bus.

USB used by computers and peripherals

TTL UART used by microcontrollers

RS232 - I don't know why we are bothering with this.

USB to RS232
RS232 to TTL UART
USB to serial

FTDI - port not recognized, drivers are supposedly installed automatically on Linux, can be built with 232 or other chips?

esp32-cam-mb  works when plugged in, does not work with my stripped down system of rx/tx only

Is my ftdi from spark from or high let go?
