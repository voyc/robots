the tello exposes a character api to a socket

we could make a arduino program to do the same thing for the skate
	forward 20 cm
	reverse 20 cm
	right 10 degrees
	left 5 degrees
	forward speed 28 kph or cps
	reverse speed 14 kph
	stop


eyes.py  - flies tello missions

eyes.py - continous loop
	read the video feed
	read the telemetry data
	convert to map data
	make adjustments to keep tello in stable hover
	listen for commands to move
	listen for command to stop
	one mission to land on the skate

wheels.py
	keep skate on course and at correct speed
	


brain.py
	continous loop
		look at map data
		make decision about next cone
		make decision about speed
		drive the skate
		drive the tello
		check batteries
		check for human input
		make decision to quit


commands sent from brain to wheels
	forward at speed 5 kph
	proceed to cone 8, circle clockwise, enter at 178 degrees, exit at 98 degrees
	increase speed to 30 kph
	slow to 14 kph
	proceed to base
	stop
